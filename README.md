This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

=======
Once you have your host setup, you'll notice the frontend cannot deploy without some basic environment variables. You'll need to configure these environment variables inside your web-hosting provider.

Usually they will have an interface where you can paste your environment variables. See [`env.example`](https://github.com/hivemindhq/portfolios/blob/main/.env.example) to see the schema for your environment variables.

> Please note, you will need to include all environment variables for this site to function properly.

## Contributing

Contributing is always welcome, whether you want to add a portfolio, or a feature to the web client, we will usually accept most pull-requests!
